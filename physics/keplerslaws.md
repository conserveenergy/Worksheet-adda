\section*{Practice Questions on Kepler's Laws for NEET}

\subsection*{Question 1:}
According to Kepler's first law of planetary motion, the orbit of a planet around the Sun is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Circular with the Sun at the center
    \item Elliptical with the Sun at the center
    \item Elliptical with the Sun at one of the foci
    \item Parabolic with the Sun at the focus
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 3. Elliptical with the Sun at one of the foci

\subsection*{Question 2:}
Kepler's second law states that the line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This law is a consequence of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conservation of energy
    \item Conservation of linear momentum
    \item Conservation of angular momentum
    \item Conservation of mass
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 3. Conservation of angular momentum

\subsection*{Question 3:}
The time period of revolution of a planet around the Sun (\( T \)) and its average distance from the Sun (\( R \)) are related by Kepler's third law as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \( T^2 \propto R \)
    \item \( T^2 \propto R^2 \)
    \item \( T^2 \propto R^3 \)
    \item \( T^2 \propto R^4 \)
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 3. \( T^2 \propto R^3 \)

\subsection*{Question 4:}
If the distance of a planet from the Sun is doubled, what will be its new time period of revolution according to Kepler's third law?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \( \sqrt{2} \) times the original
    \item \( 2 \) times the original
    \item \( 2\sqrt{2} \) times the original
    \item \( 8 \) times the original
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 3. \( 2\sqrt{2} \) times the original

\subsection*{Question 5:}
A planet moves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit. At which point in its orbit will the planet have the maximum speed?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Aphelion (farthest from the Sun)
    \item Perihelion (closest to the Sun)
    \item Midway between aphelion and perihelion
    \item At the center of the ellipse
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 2. Perihelion (closest to the Sun)

\subsection*{Question 6:}
Which of the following statements is true about Kepler's laws?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item They are applicable only to planets in our solar system.
    \item They are valid for any two-body system under gravitational interaction.
    \item They are valid only for circular orbits.
    \item They are not consistent with Newton's laws of motion.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 2. They are valid for any two-body system under gravitational interaction.

\subsection*{Question 7:}
If the orbital radius of Earth around the Sun is \( R \) and its time period is \( T \), what will be the time period of a planet whose orbital radius is \( 4R \)?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \( T \)
    \item \( 2T \)
    \item \( 4T \)
    \item \( 8T \)
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 4. \( 8T \)

\subsection*{Question 8:}
Kepler's second law is also known as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Law of orbits
    \item Law of areas
    \item Law of periods
    \item Law of gravitation
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 2. Law of areas

\subsection*{Question 9:}
A planet moves faster when it is closer to the Sun because:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The gravitational force is stronger.
    \item The angular momentum is conserved.
    \item The kinetic energy is maximum.
    \item The potential energy is minimum.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 2. The angular momentum is conserved.

\subsection*{Question 10:}
Which of the following is NOT true about Kepler's laws?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item They describe the motion of planets around the Sun.
    \item They are based on empirical observations.
    \item They are valid only for circular orbits.
    \item They were formulated before Newton's laws of gravitation.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} 3. They are valid only for circular orbits.
